## General info
This project is for my A3 assignment. My aim throughout the creative process was to create a visual digital art with the processing program. I aimed to expand my knowledge on code and literacy by using processing to create a range of different elements. 
As you can see below my final A3 project is named 'Astro - Final A3' and below it are some of the extra artworks i created in the process of creating the final one. This artwork that i created allowed me to memorise important functions and solidify my understanding of code and how to use it.	

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Processing Java

	
## Setup
 To run this project, install the program processing. Download the files in this repository and run them using Java.
 Each folder has a PDE file that can be used.
